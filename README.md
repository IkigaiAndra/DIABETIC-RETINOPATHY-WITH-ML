Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Machine Learning
This repository provides a machine learning solution for classifying Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal images. Diabetic Retinopathy is a medical condition that can result in blindness due to damage to the retina caused by diabetes. The goal of this project is to detect the severity of diabetic retinopathy using deep learning and machine learning techniques.

Project Overview
The project includes:

A dataset of retinal images (often referred to as fundus images).
A machine learning model (including techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks) to classify these images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy.
A pipeline for image preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is typically sourced from publicly available datasets such as:

Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection: A dataset of retinal images labeled with severity levels (from 0: no DR to 4: severe DR).
You can access the dataset here: Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset.

Steps to Train the Model
1. Preprocessing Data
The images need to be resized and normalized before being fed into the machine learning model. This is handled in the image_preprocessing.py file.
Augmentation techniques (such as rotation, flipping, and zooming) are applied to increase the diversity of the training data.
2. Build the Model
You can choose from different architectures. For this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used due to its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

cnn_model.py contains the architecture of the CNN.
The model uses several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to classify the images into DR severity levels.
3. Train the Model
To train the model, simply run the train.py script. This will load the data, preprocess it, and train the model:

bash
Copy code
python models/train.py
You can also train the model with different hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.

4. Evaluate the Model
After training the model, it is crucial to evaluate its performance on the test set. You can run the evaluation script:

bash
Copy code
python models/evaluate.py
This will generate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model can also be saved and used for future inference.

5. Inference
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new retinal images. For inference, run the main.py script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py --image_path <path_to_image>
Example Command for Training
To train a model with 10 epochs and a batch size of 32, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python models/train.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 32
Example Command for Evaluation
To evaluate a saved model on the test data:

bash
Copy code
python models/evaluate.py --model_path models/cnn_model.h5 --test_data data/test_images/
Model Evaluation Metrics
After running the evaluation, the following metrics will be reported:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified samples.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
F1-score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
Visualization
The project includes visualization features for the training process. You can generate:

Loss and Accuracy Plots: To track model performance over epochs.
Confusion Matrix: To assess how well the model is classifying each severity level.
Example for plotting the loss:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Model Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
Example of Model Output
Given an input retinal image, the model will predict a severity level from 0 to 4:

0: No Diabetic Retinopathy
1: Mild Diabetic Retinopathy
2: Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy
3: Severe Diabetic Retinopathy
4: Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
